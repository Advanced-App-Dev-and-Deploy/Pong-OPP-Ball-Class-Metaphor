Combine Night Stars and Chase into Black Hole
- Review the lessons of Night Stars and Chase Metaphors
- Once Coding is complete, review black hole code

Firework
- Example of Firework exploding like in the sky
- Firework stays on the table
- With last mouse click, firework chases in to the black hole of the net where the goal was

Firework Example Behaviors & Easter Eggs
- Magnet Ball
- More than one ball
- Increasing speed based on score

Collisions???

Behaviors to Consider in Pong

Teaching Order
- Chase Metaphor
- Night Stars with Midpoints or areas (off edge detection, overlapping detection)
- Black holes (combination of above)
- Fireworks

Additional Notes

Chase Metaphor
- Review basic class design
- Intoduce absolute value function by reviewing the random function
  - Instead of (0, 256) or (256) parameters, use formula

Black Holes introduces
- Introduce how Processing works in WINDOWS: must click on screen first
- Introduce a "Start Button": SPACEBAR
- Introduce Quit Button, through keyboard
- What happens when these are coded, according to how a computer thinks
- Pure Java Classes - Mathematics only
  - Thus all visual data must happen in Driver, with Processing.JAVA Classes, or procedures
- Access Modifiers, especially static variables (exist in a class, but accessible everywhere)
  - Public
  - Private
  - Static
